## What this is

llm-repl — an LLM chat completion as a branchable continuation: the tape
(`messages[]`) is an immutable, forkable VALUE; the repl is the PLACE tapes
live. Humans (TUI), models (self-eval), editors ≡ equal nREPL clients of one
persistent core. Two consumers: standalone tool (`bb llm-repl`) and library
for anima (`us.whitford/llm-repl` on Clojars, `:complete-fn` injection).
v0.2.0 tagged ∧ public ≡ the accrete-as-we-go baseline.

## Frontier

**v0.3.0 design RATIFIED @ `4cce4be`** — full-codebase assessment folded
into `design/architecture.md` (layers, ns map, decisions D1–D7, formal
shape, build/CI) ⊕ `design/library-contract.md` (stable surface for anima).
The refactor targets those documents. Knowledge metabolized out of this
file: [container](knowledge/container.md) ·
[attach-topology](knowledge/attach-topology.md) ·
[self-eval](knowledge/self-eval.md) ·
[tui-design-rules](knowledge/tui-design-rules.md).

**Next pickup: refactor step 1 — `tape` ns (extract ⊕ absorb chat-memory) ⊕
its tests.** Pure, zero risk, seeds the test suite. Full order in
architecture § refactor order.

## Live invariants (violable tomorrow — the rest live in the design)

- Registry stays EDN: `:complete-fn` injected per-call, NEVER stored; no
  fn/atom/record in a session (serialized over nREPL every view refresh).
- rf G1: eval-rf keeps the 1-arity completer. G2: eager drivers only.
- bb.edn ≡ deps.edn (bb primary, JVM superset; escapement via Clojars
  coordinate — changes upstream need a RELEASE).
- NO nucleus/boot seed in the repo — preamble ≡ config; the licensing
  boundary is ~/.config/llm-repl/config.edn. AGENTS.md with nucleus content
  stays UNTRACKED.
- nREPL ≡ unauthenticated eval — `:bind "0.0.0.0"` only behind a wall.
- Config stickiness: open! persists; absence ≠ reset
  (memories/config-stickiness).
- Knowledge scope: mementum here ≡ llm-repl the INSTRUMENT; model findings
  gathered THROUGH it belong to anima.

## Queue

1. Refactor steps 1–8 (architecture § refactor order): tape → registry →
   completion → api ns → client long-poll → tui split → daemon/roster →
   build.clj ⊕ workflows.
2. Human terminal pass: TUI over LOCAL daemon
   (spawn→attach→detach→reattach→bb stop) — programmatic paths verified;
   live render unconfirmed (container-attach TUI already human-verified).
3. `compact!` live trial once step 4 lands (self-compaction — the model
   compacting its own tape).
4. Tape persistence to disk (daemon-owned; placeholder in design).
5. MCP facade compiled from `(manual)` (placeholder in design).
6. `:bbin/bin` entry (deferred until feedback); split-pane tape view;
   compare pane on the overlay slot; `bb status --all`.
